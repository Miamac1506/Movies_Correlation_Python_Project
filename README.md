# Movies_Correlation_Python_Project

### Introduction
In this project, I use Python to look at what variables affect the gross revenue from movies.

### Data

The data includes a list of movie information including title, director, cast, date released, ratings, duration, revenue, votings, etc. 

### Proposal

* Use Python to clean up the data and visualize the data
* Using regression model to see the correlation between variables
* There are correlations between votes and gross earnings, and gross earnings and revenue
